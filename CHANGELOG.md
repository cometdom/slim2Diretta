# Changelog

All notable changes to slim2diretta are documented in this file.

## v0.1.0 - Test Version (2026-02-27)

Initial test release for validation by beta testers.

### Features

- **Slimproto protocol**: Clean-room implementation from public documentation (no GPL code)
  - Player registration (HELO), stream control (strm), volume (audg), device settings (setd)
  - LMS auto-discovery via UDP broadcast
  - Heartbeat keep-alive, elapsed time reporting
  - Player name reporting to LMS/Roon

- **Audio formats**:
  - FLAC decoding via libFLAC
  - PCM/WAV/AIFF container parsing with raw PCM fallback (Roon)
  - Native DSD: DSF (LSB-first) and DFF/DSDIFF (MSB-first) container parsing
  - DSD rates: DSD64, DSD128, DSD256, DSD512
  - DoP (DSD over PCM): automatic detection and conversion to native DSD (Roon compatibility)
  - WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE support for WAV headers

- **Diretta output** (shared DirettaSync v2.0):
  - Automatic sink format negotiation (PCM and DSD)
  - DSD bit-order and byte-swap conversion (LSB/MSB, LE/BE)
  - Lock-free SPSC ring buffer with SIMD optimizations
  - Adaptive packet sizing with jumbo frame support
  - Quick resume for consecutive same-format tracks

- **Operational**:
  - Systemd service template (`slim2diretta@<target>`) for multi-instance
  - Interactive installation script (`install.sh`)
  - Prebuffer with flow control (500ms target, adaptive for high DSD rates)
  - Pause/unpause with silence injection for clean transitions
  - SIGUSR1 runtime statistics dump

### Known Limitations

- Linux only (requires root for RT threads)
- No MP3, AAC, OGG, ALAC support (FLAC and PCM/DSD only)
- No volume control (bit-perfect: forced to 100%)
- No automated tests (manual testing with LMS + DAC)
